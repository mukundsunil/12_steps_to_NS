# 12_steps_to_NS
CFD Python, a.k.a. the 12 steps to Navier-Stokes, is a practical module for learning the foundations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) by coding solutions to the basic partial differential equations that describe the physics of fluid flow. The module was part of a course taught by Prof. Lorena Barba between 2009 and 2013 in the Mechanical Engineering department at Boston University (Prof. Barba since moved to the George Washington University).

The module assumes only basic programming knowledge (in any language) and some background in partial differential equations and fluid mechanics. The "steps" were inspired by ideas of Dr. Rio Yokota, who was a post-doc in Prof. Barba's lab until 2011, and the lessons were refined by Prof. Barba and her students over several semesters teaching the CFD course.
